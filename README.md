# HPProBook450G10HighStand
A DIY stand for HP ProBook 450 G10 notebook, which was built from [3d prints](#STL) and some metal parts from a hardware store. The high side of the stand is 13cm high (With rubber feet attached to the bottom) and lifts my notebook display to the same level as my external monitors.

## Appendix

### Metal parts

![Metal parts](assets/images/MetalParts.jpg)

- 3x brass tubes (Outer diameter 4.0mm, inner diameter >= 3.0mm)
- 3x brass M3 threaded rods with the length of one brass tube plus 2.3cm
- 6x M3 nuts

I used brass tubes with a length of 26cm, but you can use other lengths. The threaded rods are sticked in the brass tubes. 

If the threaded rods do not fit through the holes in the 3d printed side parts, the printed holes should be re-drilled with a 3.0 mm drill bit.

The M3 nuts on
- the left side will be pressed in the place holders of the [3d left side print](STL/HPProBook450G10HighStandLeftSide.stl) ![Nut in left side](assets/images/NutInLeftSide.jpg)
- the right side will be pressed the place holders of the three [3d knob prints](STL/HPProBook450G10HighStandKnob.stl) ![Nut in knob](assets/images/NutInKnob.jpg)
